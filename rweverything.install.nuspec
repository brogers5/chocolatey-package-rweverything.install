## **PACKAGE NOTES**

The installer executed by this package was built using Inno Setup. For advanced setup scenarios, refer to [Inno Setup's command-line interface documentation](https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setupcmdline). Any desired arguments can be appended to (or optionally overriding with the `--override-arguments` switch) the package's default install arguments with the `--install-arguments` option.

Installer-specific details (e.g. Setup configuration and supported Languages, Components, and Tasks) can be found in the Inno Setup Script file, which has been extracted using [Inno Setup Unpacker](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/innounp) and reuploaded for quick reference:
* [32-bit installer](https://github.com/brogers5/chocolatey-package-rweverything.install/tree/v1.7/install_script_x86.iss)
* [64-bit installer](https://github.com/brogers5/chocolatey-package-rweverything.install/tree/v1.7/install_script_x64.iss)

For future upgrade operations, consider opting into Chocolatey's `useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades` feature to avoid having to pass the same arguments with each upgrade:
```
choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades
```
